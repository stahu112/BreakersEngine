# EngineV2
Second attemt on making a game engine backed up by actual work experience

Planned to be a library providing a framework for making games, like game class with already coded main loop, object interface,
collision detection, asset manager etc.
W.I.P

I believe this should be in "good enough/kinda working" state by the end of june
